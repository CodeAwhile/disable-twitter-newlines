Disable Twitter Newlines
========================

Simple Chrome extension that disables newlines in tweets.

Overview
--------

Twitter recently added a feature that preserves newlines in tweets.
Many users find that annoying, which is why this extension exists.
It returns tweets to their normal, collapsed state, as the creators of HTML intended :)

To view a tweet with original whitespace, expand it.

Installation
------------

Go to the Chrome Web Store with the following link and click "Add To Chrome"
